Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
It represents a Bird. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I implemented feed method that allows the bird to feed before increasing its weight. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I tried to make it as simple as I could, so It would be easier to navigate the functions the bird would do and adjust it as per the contract because not everything was making sense initially. I would suggest next person to brainstorm more before starting.
